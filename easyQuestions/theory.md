Basic Operations

The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations. The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure.

    Traversing
    Searching
    Insertion
    Deletion
    Sorting
    Merging


Linked List 
Basic Operations

Following are the basic operations supported by a list.

    Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.

    Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.

    Insert Last − Adds an element at the end of the list.

    Delete Last − Deletes an element from the end of the list.

    Insert After − Adds an element after an item of the list.

    Delete − Deletes an element from the list using the key.

    Display forward − Displays the complete list in a forward manner.

    Display backward − Displays the complete list in a backward manner.


Basic Operations

    push() − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.

    pop() − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.

Functionality of stack 

    peek() − get the top data element of the stack, without removing it.

    isFull() − check if stack is full.

    isEmpty() − check if stack is empty.

    At all times, we maintain a pointer to the last PUSHed data on the stack. As this pointer always represents the top of the stack, hence named top. The top pointer provides top value of the stack without actually removing it.


QUEUE

Basic Operations

Queue operations may involve initializing or defining the queue, utilizing it, and then completely erasing it from the memory. Here we shall try to understand the basic operations associated with queues −

    enqueue() − add (store) an item to the queue.

    dequeue() − remove (access) an item from the queue.

Few more functions are required to make the above-mentioned queue operation efficient. These are −

    peek() − Gets the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

    isfull() − Checks if the queue is full.

    isempty() − Checks if the queue is empty.
